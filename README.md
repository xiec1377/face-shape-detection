# Face shape detection

### Description
Playing around with JS Mediapipe face mesh landmarks to identify types of faces (oval, round, square, heart, diamond). Currently using simple algorithms to determine face shapes.

### Later features
- Using face mesh landmarks to determine face feature distances, types (e.g. whether eyes are wide-set, narrow, nose is narrow, etc.)
- Use pytorch image classification model using open source face shape datasets to determine types of faces
